### I am going to build a model that can predict the price of a property based on certain aspects like, square feet(sq. ft), number of bedrooms, bathrooms etc.

### I am also going to build a website which will do price prediction for you.

### I will cover some of the core Data Science concepts such as Data Cleaning, Feature Engineering, Dimensionality Reduction, Outlier Removal etc.

### Tools and Technologies:
* Python
* Pandas for Data Cleaning
* Matplotlib for Data Visualisation
* Scikit-learn for Model Building
* Flask for Back-end server
* HTML, CSS, JavaScript for the website
